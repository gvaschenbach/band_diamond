## How have movies changed over time?
While the majority of movie genres have increased approximately exponentially over time, there are several that have remained low interest, including TV movies, westerns, and war movies.
Several genres also pulled away from the general trend including drama, comedy, action, and thriller categories.
All of these would be good choices for a new movie, except comedy, which has fallen dramatically in the last year.
I would recommend focusing on drama, which has remained the top genre since 2010.

## How do the attributes differ between Universal Pictures and Paramount Pictures?
Universal Pictures generally makes more movies of every genre (5 out of 10 categories). Universal Pictures is very successful at making family movies with high ROI, while Paramount excels at Adventure and Science Fiction movies. This suggests that there are characteristics of production compaines that favor certain genres. Further analysis on what those characterisitcs are might prove valuable.

## How have movies based on novels performed relative to movies not based on novels?
As seen on the first chart, the popularity of movies based on novels has increased faster than movies not based on novels, though overall the audience for movies based on novels is still relatively small compared with the audience for all other movies (see tab 3, panel 2).

## Personal choice analysis
One interesting aspect of movie data might be how runtime impacts both viewer votes and viewer popularity ratings. Such an analysis might suggest how long of a movie to make to acheive greater success with viewers.
The analysis on tab 4 suggests that the optimal runtime for popularity is between 80 and 160 minutes (panel 1), with a downward trend over time (panel 2).
