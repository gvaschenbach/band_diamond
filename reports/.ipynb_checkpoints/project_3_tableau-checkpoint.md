## How have movies changed over time?
While the majority of movie genres have increased approximately exponentially over time, there are several that have remained low interest, including TV movies, westerns, and war movies.
Several genres also pulled away from the general trend including drama, comedy, action, and thriller categories.
All of these would be good choices for a new movie, except comedy, which has fallen dramatically in the last year.
I would recommend focusing on drama, which has remained the top genre since 2010.
