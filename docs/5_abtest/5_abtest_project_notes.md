TODOs for AB testing project:
Trim data file to 2015-04-29 through 2015-07-21 and 2016-04-29 through 2016-07-21.
Question: Do we need additional months for trend matching?
Do I compare control stores pre and post and treatment stores pre and post, looking for an 18% difference in profitability?

Use square feet, average monthly sales and city as matching criteria?



Question: Was there an 18% increase in profit (gross_margin) in test stores vs. treatment stores? If so, roll out the new products to all stores.
