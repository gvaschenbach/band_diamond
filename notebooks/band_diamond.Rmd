## Step 1: Understanding the Model 
### According to the linear model provided, if a diamond is 1 carat heavier than another with the same cut and clarity, how much more should we expect to pay? Why?

### If you were interested in a 1.5 carat diamond with a Very Good cut (represented by a 3 in the model) and a VS2 clarity rating (represented by a 5 in the model), how much would the model predict you should pay for it?

## Step 2: Visualize the Data 
### Plot 1 - Plot the data for the diamonds in the database, with carat on the x-axis and price on the y-axis. 
### Plot 2 - Plot the data for the diamonds for which you are predicting prices with carat on the x-axis and predicted price on the y-axis. 

### What strikes you about this comparison? After seeing this plot, do you feel confident in the modelâ€™s ability to predict prices? 

## Step 3: Make a Recommendation
### What price do you recommend the jewelry company to bid? Please explain how you arrived at that number. HINT: The number should be 7 digits.
